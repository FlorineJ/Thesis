tiling_script:
Create bigger tiles to match substations size

organise tiling to deal with several tiles=>done

sliding window instead of tiling?=>could but a stride in the tiling_script

avoid black pixels during tiling

check if tile size is the same as the medium paper

add WB tool to train script

New script
Undersampling with GHSL or other: select based on landuse/landcover
